# Jumia Deal Explorer – Intelligent Electronics Recommender

This project is a complete data pipeline and dashboard application designed to help users identify the best electronics deals on the Moroccan e-commerce platform Jumia. It also includes an initial price comparison module with Electroplanet, offering insights into pricing differences for equivalent products across vendors.

The system collects, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes product data in a structured and interactive way. The final result is a Streamlit web application where users can browse top deals by category, filter products by brand or price, and interact with a natural language chatbot.

## Features

- Automated scraping of electronic product listings from Jumia using Playwright and BeautifulSoup.
- Basic scraping module for Electroplanet for cross-vendor comparisons.
- Data cleaning and enrichment with product type classification (e.g., TV, smartphone, earpods).
- Fuzzy brand detection and normalization.
- Streamlit dashboard showing:
  - Top 5 deals by product category
  - Filterable tables with price and brand options
  - Visual analytics for price distribution
  - Natural language chatbot for querying products
- Cross-platform price comparison engine to match similar items and detect price gaps.

## Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- Playwright (headless browser automation)
- BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- RapidFuzz (string matching)
- Streamlit (dashboard and chatbot)
- Matplotlib (basic visualization)
